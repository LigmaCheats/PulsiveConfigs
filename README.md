# PulsiveConfigs
This repo is full of public Pulsive Client configs which can be used on a variety of servers.

# IMPORTANT!

Time and effort are put into every config that is posted here. Please make sure that if you are using the config you are crediting the correct users in the correct places. Thank you

# HOW TO USE

The way you use a config from here working on pulsive is as follows. First, create a new empty config on pulsive, this can be done by using the "Create" button. Now head over to the config that you would like to use, for example, "hypixel.txt" and click on it so you can see the data, now use GitHub's feature to view the code "Raw" by clicking the Raw button. This should open it up just on its own. Now, press CTRL+A then CTRL+C which will copy the config to your clipboard. Now head over to Pulsive Client and click on the config you would like to overwrite/add to. Lastly, press "Import from clipboard" which will load the config! Don't forget to hit the save button before doing anything else to make sure you don't have to repeat this process all over again!

# "Offical" configs

Note that these are not offical configs for pulsive, they are just the best configs that I, ligma, see are bypassing the best! (They are the best to use if you want a bypassing up to date config!)
